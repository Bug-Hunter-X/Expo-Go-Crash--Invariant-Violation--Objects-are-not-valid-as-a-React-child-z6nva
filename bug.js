This error occurs when using the Expo Go app to test your React Native application.  The app may crash or display a blank screen, and the console might show a cryptic error message like `Invariant Violation: Objects are not valid as a React child` without clearly indicating the source. This is often due to an unexpected object or data structure being passed as a child to a React component. For instance, it could arise from incorrect data fetching, where the response isn't properly handled or transformed before being displayed. In some cases, asynchronous operations not awaiting proper resolution before updating components may cause this issue.
