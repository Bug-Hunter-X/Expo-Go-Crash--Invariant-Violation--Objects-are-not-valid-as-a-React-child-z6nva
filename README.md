# Expo Go Crash: Invariant Violation: Objects are not valid as a React child

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in React Native applications using Expo Go. The bug manifests as a crash or blank screen in the Expo Go app, accompanied by the error message `Invariant Violation: Objects are not valid as a React child`.  The cause is typically an unexpected object being rendered as a child of a React component. This often stems from improper data handling, specifically, asynchronous operations or incorrect data transformations.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` or `yarn install`.
3. Start the development server using `expo start`. 
4. Run the app in Expo Go. You should observe the crash or blank screen.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that only valid React children (primitives like strings and numbers, or other React components) are passed to parent components. Often, this requires explicit checks and handling of data fetched from asynchronous operations, using appropriate state management techniques to avoid rendering objects directly.
